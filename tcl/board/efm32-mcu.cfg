# Configuration for EFM32 boards with on-board SEGGER J-Link
#
# Tested with Tiny, Giant and Zero Gecko Starter Kit.
#
#
# Previous tests indicate that -mcu and -out are swapped on Zero Gecko STKs,
# but that is yet untested.
#
# The EMUCOM messages sent around here were observed on the USB output of
# EnergyMicro's eACommander and are replayed without any deeper understanding
# of their internals.
#
# The -off and -in will always fail in the sense of OpenOCD not being able to
# establish a connection to the target. This is expected by the design of the
# Gecko boards (those commands remove the onboard debugger's access to the
# available targets) -- the effect takes place anyway. The config scripts are
# included as they allow putting the board into a mode where the onboard target
# can be debugged from outside, and for sake of completeness.
