#
# Analog Devices ADSP-SC584-EZBRD evaluation board
#
# evaluation boards by Analog Devices (and designs derived from them) use a non-standard 10-pin 0.05" ARM Cortex Debug Connector
# pin 9 (GND or GNDDetect) has been usurped with JTAG /TRST
# as a result, a standards-compliant debug pod will only force the processor's debug interface into reset, preventing usage
# so, a connector adapter must be employed on these boards to isolate or otherwise prevent /TRST from being asserted

# Analog expects users to use their proprietary ICE-1000 / ICE-2000 with this board, but
# this is an ARM target (and subject to the qualification above) many ARM debug pods should be compatible

# Analog's silicon supports SWD and JTAG, but their ICE is limited to JTAG
# SWD is chosen here, as:
# 1) SWD is more efficient
# 2) OpenOCD in JTAG mode assumes /TRST usage
# /TRST is not part of the "Cortex" 10-pin ARM connector (which is why Analog overloaded the pinout)

transport select swd

# chosen speed is 'safe' choice, but your adapter may be capable of much higher rates
